## Description 📝

When creating an open source project on GitHub, having a high-quality README is crucial. It should detail the app's purpose, usage instructions, installation process, issue reporting guidelines, and contribution guidelines to encourage collaboration from other developers.

To streamline the README creation process, I can generate a README file using a command-line application, allowing me to focus more on project development. The task at hand is to develop a command-line application that dynamically creates a professional README.md file based on user input, utilizing the Inquirer package.

To get started, I should clone the starter code repository, create my own repository with the starter code, and not fork the starter code repository. The application will be invoked using the command node index.js. Additionally, I need to provide a walkthrough video demonstrating the application's functionality and include the video link in the README.

The user story for this project is: As a developer, I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.

The acceptance criteria include generating a professional README.md with specific sections like Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. It should also include the project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, chosen license badge, GitHub username with a link, email address with contact instructions, and functional links in the Table of Contents.

To get started, I should create a .gitignore file, include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/, set up a package.json with the required dependencies using npm init, and include a video showcasing the user flow of the application along with any necessary screenshots to aid in understanding the project's purpose and functionality.

## Technologies-Used 💻🖥🖱
The technologies used in creating a command-line application for generating a professional README.md file include Node.js and the Inquirer package. To install the Inquirer package version 8.2.4, you can use the following command:

npm i inquirer@8.2.4

## Installation 💻
To get started with the project, follow these guidelines:

Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ to prevent the node_modules directory from being tracked or uploaded to GitHub.
Ensure your repository includes a package.json file with the required dependencies. You can create one by running npm init when setting up the project before installing any dependencies.
Include a video demonstrating the typical user flow through your application, showcasing the prompts and responses after user selections.
Add any necessary screenshots to help users understand the purpose and function of your application, which can be useful for potential employers or other developers in the future.
To install dependencies, run these commands:
```
npm install package-name
```

## Usage 🏆
node index.js

## Tests 🧪
To run tests, run these commands:
```
npm test
```
